# Variadic variables

Data that can vary can be stored in variables. These a created with the `var` keyword.

```
var name = "Luke Skywalker"
```

You can specify types with your variables.

```
var String = "Luke Skywalker"
```

> These two are different types. When given no type, the variable `name` is assigned to a `string` type. The `String` type is a type that is built on top of the primitive `string` type that implements various traits.

# Constants

Constants are unchangeable data that is baked in to the byte code. Once assigned, they cannot be changed in runtime. They are created with the `const` keyword.

```
const name = "Luke Skywalker"
```

You can specify types with your constants.

```
const String = "Luke Skywalker"
```
